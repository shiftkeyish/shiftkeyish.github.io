<P>Cold snap, polar vortex, and squall. These things happened either concurrently or in a certain arrangment, I am unclear. What is clear is that on Thursday afternoon Instagram was flooded with photos of the squall, characterized by fast-moving winds and a celestial dumping of snow. Then, it was so cold I thought my nose would fall off on the way to SP's co-op where I shrugged off sex in favor of falling asleep within moments of my arrival.</P>

<p>Our president continues to entertain us with his antics as he doesn't really know what else to do. He is a real estate mogul and a reality tv star. He knows how to build things (a wall), and antagonize his housemates (Pelosi), so this is what he does. I have nothing to say about Trump that hasn't been written over and over again in liberal think-pieces, except this: I'd rather have him in office than any other Republican that was running for president. His presidency, unintentially, has been the best thing for the liberal cause. If it was Cruz in office, we'd be twiddling our thumbs while they quietly rip the country apart. </p>

<p>The cold is biting, as they say, and it does feel personal. An attack. They say one braves a cold, and I braved it for the half mile yesterday afternoon to the UPS loading dock by the West Side Highway. Inside, large people, two men and two women. The women were African-American, security guards, they took no interest in me. The men were white, loud with long, thick legs and straight backs, bundled in poly-filled coats the color of a dirty floor. One took my postcard, the one that said a box couldn't be delivered because there wasn't a Suite number, and disappeared behind doors that swung. The other said goodbye and swaggered into the cold, bright day as if it was a good one to die.</p>

<p>The women and I filled the small, musty waiting area with our silence. In the corner, an old cassette-player boombox rusted on small table, on the floor around it, half a dozen blooming, potted, poinsettas.</p>

<p>SP was laid off his job yesterday; I was anxious for him. For some reason I thought it was Wednesday, but it was Tuesday. I told him I had to see <i>Network</i> on what would be tonight, but it is tomorrow. It's a whole story, but basically he ended up in my apartment last night when neither of us were really up for socializing because we both thought we wouldn't see each other until Friday otherwise. </p>

<p>Turned out I was freeish tonight, having only had drinks with BT. The previous night was based on a lie, not that much happened, but I was cranky and weird and we haven't spoken much today on WhatsApp. I think the fog is clearing/honeymoon is ending. We cuddled and had fun, but I couldn't shake the crank. </p>

<p>He irritated me. I have been waiting for this. I don't know if I should bother telling him about my flub. Tomorrow, I can just say I am having drinks with BT, the old switcharoo. What am I even talking about. I'm so fucked.</p>

<p>Two weeks into the new year. SP is still in my life. We are happy. We sit side by side in diners. He doesn't care if there is cat hair in my bed. It is "wild and sweet" as I remember a character's singing described in a screenplay, a description that stayed with me. Wild and sweet, like a raspberry pulled from a bush on a summer day, like a gangly teen cannonballing into a pool, like two wolf cubs nipping each in a bright lea. I came across the phrase when I was interning at a production company as a script reader and I've lived my whole life for those two words ever since. </p>

<p>The script was produced in 2000. It became "Songcatcher" starring Janet McTeer.</p>

<p>Last night I watched Inside Llewlyn Davis and Wonder. </p>

<p>En route to San Antonio. I'm proud of myself for not getting glass of wine, I'll have one with AD later. AD was in my high school crew, we didn't talk more many years, but Facebook helps with that. I think Ann can feel like an outsider at times in Texas, and whatever makes her feel outside, I can help with that. Her and her husband have two kids and I dig their family where I don't dig most. </p>

<p>Monster that I am, babies and toddlers make me angry. Their existence makes me livid. The parents most of all. The worst thing anyone can do for the environment is create another consumer. Where is the global propaganda machine discouraging people from having children? I have to admit, when I see immigrants at the border pointing to their five children bemoaning their inability to feed them, I can only think: why are you having children you can't afford? Fucking Catholicism, man, how do we convince the church to allow birth control? </p>

  <p>TK is here, on the other end of the couch. Both of us have pillows in our laps and laptops on those pillows. On Youtube, is Queen. A medley of videos from the 70s, pixelated and buffering. We have been meeting reguarly on Saturday mornings at the Jax diner, and sometimes later in my apartment to write. So, I should be writing something.</p>

  <p>For a little over three weeks now, I've been seeing SP. He introduced himself on OKCupid while I was on the train to Moishe's to buy a chocolate babka. I was nursing a bad cold that would later get worse, but still trying to get to TK's house in New Jersey for Shabbatgiving. </p>

<p>I had been on OKCupid for a while, but I had not responded to anyone, or initated a chat. Just lurking, crushing hard on a person who clearly had no interest in me. </p>

<p>But this guy was checking off boxes: bisexual, non-monogamous, tall, non-white, salty black curls, and he lived in my neighborhood. He seemed genuinely curious about me as a person, asking brave questions about my approach to polyamory. He lives with his spouse of nearly fifteen years who transitioned to a male identity about 2 years ago. Around the same time, SP came out as bisexual and they decides to open up their marriage. They live in a co-op 10 blocks away, a nice one, I've been there, and fucked him in their bed. SP's spouse has a partner or two, I don't know much about them. SP has two other partners, and now a third. He asked if I wanted to partner up last night. I don't know what this means, but I said yes.</p>

  <p>I know what it means in an academic sense. He practices relationship anarchy, where all partners are perceived as equals. From what I've read, practitioners do not differentiate between romantic partners and platonic partners, sexual and non-sexual. Him and I are sexual, intensely so. I feel open and free, less silly. I even talk to him during sex, something I have never done. I even have goddamn orgasms, real ones, regularly, more than once.</p>

  <p>My friend says that maybe we are having such good sex "perhaps it's the fact that he will never be yours." But that implies that I want him to be mine. She's projecting, but there's a truth there that isn't so cynical. In a polyamorous relationship I can't conflate property with self worth.</p>

  <p>SP is the first non-white person I have been with. His father is African-American, his mother is white but from the West Indies. He is a programmer and has traits of Joe, and traits that are not-Joe. He turns me on. Long-limbed, he can wrap his arms around me nearly twice. I feel small and safe, then adventurous and wild. I love being naked with him more than I have ever loved being naked with anybody, except maybe, briefly, my first. But I was too young to let myself go. I'm not too young any more.</p>

  <p>I went to China, Tibet, then came back. I kept a written journal during that time. Maybe someday I will transcribe it here, but unlikely to do before my retirement. God, retirement, what a glorious thing to think about, an unlikely thing.</p>

  <p>These days, I am crushing on someone I should not be crushing on, a pattern, an addiction, a sign I am not on my medication and I am not. Another glorious thing. The psychiatrist's office required that I make an appointment once a month in order to renew my medication. This devolved into a scheduling shitshow that obstructed my access to first the Lexepro, then the Wellbutrin. So I'm off now, horny, crazy. I feel hated at work, tearful at music videos, so angry at things that happened two decades go my heart beats at a frightening speed. On meds, I can't focused because I am too content to care, but now I am too distracted to care.</p>

  <p>The Copywriter is moving to Baltimore, perhaps only for three months. I couldn't hear in the loud restaurant, an overpriced, overdecorated pizza place in SOHO, packed with tall, young people. He clearly had something to tell me, but instead of saying it, I guessed. I guessed right. We went to a quieter place. We feel sad, kind of, hugging and stroking a lot. What does it mean? That I will visit him over labor day. </p>

  <p>My feelings about the Copywriter are muted but they are there.</p>

<p>That perfect, NYC day. Breezy, sunny, thinned of trauma. I went to Central Park with Lexicon, Hol and her husband. Blankets, ukuleles, paper cups full of wine then beer. We played frisbee, but it was a cheap one I bought at the dollar store; it broke and cut Hol's hand. Two men in red, MAGA-style baseball hats sat near us. We couldn't believe it. We played frisbee in their space to read the hats better. "Make Skolnick Great Again" - some inside thing. They packed up and moved away. We were rude. Fuck these idiots. I walked forever trying to find a bathroom. Children everywhere, riding unicorns twisted out of balloons. I tried to chat a man up on OkCupid, but I was weird and he never answered. </p>

<p>The Professor was not loud. He was 47 but gangly like a teen. His long limbs crossed and uncrossed at the bar, spidery, balletic. I overdid it on the grim and goth; I mentioned cannibalism no less than three times. I wasn't as attracted to him as I wanted to be, as I felt like I should be. Remember when the Ex-Con walked into the bar? I wanted to grab him by the shirt. God, he was hot, chauvenistic, uneducated, loud, stinking of sex. 

<p>Now that the Copywriter is gone the holes in my relationship with TK are gaping. She lives below me, I've asked to hang out but she does not want to hang out. I feel incompetant in her presence, a disappointment, an albatross. The older sister who abandoned her, broke her heart, and returned a weepy, chaotic, man-seeking mess. We see each other regularly as a trio, with Shirley or someone else, never just her and I. Grown apart, I guess, I lost her when I left for SF, when I supported Bernie Sanders, when I yelled at her twice on two different vacations, apparently three different vacations although I don't remember one. Why do I do that? </p>

<p>It is very uncomfortable talking about men with her. She doesn't want to hear it I can tell. I don't know why. I kind of do, but I don't want to presume. She narrows her eyes, sighs, doesn't really understand where I'm coming from, pissed off that I expect her too. We went for drinks with Shirley last night. I was supposed to tell them the breakup story as a parable of female empowerment. There was no such story. So, I re-told the story of the Neighbor just to give them their money's worth. </p>

<p>The Copywriter and I broke up, I think. It was a very adult conversation, easy, unbittered. We may go to the movies this weekend. We may still go to a Whitney exhibit opening together. We may cuddle again. He looked good when he came over to get his stuff. That was probably intentional. I think he agrees we aren't going anywhere. He's in transition. He hates his job and moved in with his mother so he could look for work in other cities. He can't come here because the cat kills him. I can't really talk on the phone, he is too impatient to text. Seems silly, but we can't communicate well enough to go deep, only well enough to go to dinner and the movies. He's not as radical as I need someone in my life to be. He doesn't feel responsible to change the system. He doesn't feel responsible for anything at all, except himself, and his mother. </p>

<p>I have a date tonight with a Professor. He's radical and loves cinema, a divorcee with a published book under his belt. He's skinny and tall, so I'm not sure about that. We'll see. I just hope he's loud. I figured as a teacher he must be. </p>

<p>The East Coast summer is here. The week has flirted with 3-figure tempretures. "The air like soup" wrote Salman Rushdie in some book. The air is, indeed, like soup, spiced with exotic flavors of garbage, cat litter, and cigarette smoke. </p>

<p>This morning, I promised myself I'd cut down on the sugar and the alcohol. My dinner this evening is a donut and a glass of red wine. I spent Memorial Day weekend in a stupor, picking fights with the Copywriter about Harvey Weinstein, his smug face on his perp walk, some Rogers and Hammerstein biography under his arm. I am beyond broke. My mother lent me $500. I've been eating junk food. The world is numb and soft, like the foam mattress I lay in for hours and hours, remembering things. RR, AS, and I went dancing in the neighborhood J and I lived in. I got off at the Atlantic Barclays and my glasses fogged up with memories of long, summer night walks with my dog. You could feel the storm coming, the 9 0'clock air thick and cool, hand her ears perked or flattened depending on the proximity of another dog. Will I spend the rest of my life remembering my dog and my cat? But not J, never J. Only us, the family we cobbled together from death and circumstance. </p>

<p>I am depressed again. My boss had a stroke. We don't really know what is happening. He is being "weaned off a respirator." </p>

<p>The university library is thick enough with melancholy when he is there, but when he is gone, it is unbearable. There is no kindred spirit. Is this my covert narcissim? I am not sad he had a stroke, I am sad he is not there to soothe my battered ego? This is a problem, or is it?</p>

<p>I am not sure what is the difference between depression and narcissim. It seems to be a matter of perspective.</p>

<p>I have achieved what I set out to do: to have a not-so-terrible day job that pays well so I can have the freedom to be creative. But now, I have no will to be creative. I am tired, lazy, and want to do little but watch my face fall until it is ashes in a cheap urn. I want to be drunk until I'm dead, granules of sugar in my hair, a smear of choclate at the corner of my mouth. Go ahead, feel sorry for me, You live on the surface, skimming. Your spouse and your child and your family adventures. Not that it matters. We end up in the same place. </p>

<p> I slept in the dress I wore yesterday, and here I am in it still. Marcel is darting around the apartment in a fashion I believe is called "the zoomies". My friend of 25 years visited over the weekend. We caught to Bowie exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum on Friday with the Copywriter. She took twice as long to get through the exhibit as we did, my being a passing Bowie fan and the Copywriter having no attention span. The exhibit is eye-popping, immersive, and about 1.5 rooms too big. Despite the giant screens, innovative use of blue-tooth headsets, and fabulous costumes, my biggest take away was Bowie's unflappable sincerity throughout it all.

<p>I mistook the meaning of the word "obsequious" with the meaning of the word "ostentatious" and in this way I will start the day. "Hubris" is a word that has been popping up in the print media I devour, often to characterize Trump and his administration. Every time I come across it, I look it up, and then promptly forget its meaning. I tend to mix it up with "habeas corpus" which is similar sounding when you say them outloud, sort of. </p>

<p>My brain often works superficially in this way, prioritizing appearances over context to distinguish words, people, memories. Perhaps this is the consequence of rote learning, or maybe I'm just a "visual learner." Or, maybe, I just don't give a fuck. </p>

<p>I met the Copywriters mother over the weekend, against my better judgement. She is very beautiful, a classic. Her home decorated with impeccable taste. I stood in her living room, surrounded by gray things peppered with dark brown things - arranged deftly as if posing for a JC Penny catalog - in my shabby jean jacket, hiking pants, and "Grand Theft Otter" tshirt, feeling 15 years old. It felt great.</p>

<p>My feelings toward the Copywriter remain ambivilant and unchanging. He alternately annoys me and charms me. If I am too break up with him, I need to do it soon. But what stops me? My friend KT reminds me that friendship does not a romantic relatioship make, and that this is how I got stuck with JS for so long and so unhappily. The Copywriter and I are better suited in terms of our interests. But we fall easily into each other and he doesn't seem to mind my needing space. </p>

<p>I heard from my San Francisco Neighbor last night. For him, the romantic feeling was clear and strong, but manageable. It wasn't like with the others the three that chemically altered me into another state of mind. With the Neighbor, things were soft and sweet, falling gently. Rain. Blossoms. And as VC said so loudly, "he's really handsome."</p>

<p>Another word I always have had trouble remembering it's meaning is "perjorative." I think I've gotten the hang of it lately though</p>

<p>The weather has turned. Parks are many-colored and crowded. May Day in Washington Square Park was electrified by a pro-union rally, the Locals identified by matching t-shirts and handheld signs. I made an appearance, applauded, instagrammed, and floated back home with my arms bare. I've finished The Fig Eater. The ending disappointed, but I relished the time and place it took me too during long subway rides. The trains are so crowded I often can't reach a bar to hold on to, so I raise my arm and steady myself on the ceiling with my longest finger. With the other hand, I hold my book, and it is in this way I am transported to Vienna in 1910. </p>

<p>But now I've moved to James Baldwin's Giovanni's Room with its bold portrait of homosexuality in 1950s Paris. And this is the most exciting thing that has happened to me this week. More exciting, even, than seeing Ralph Nader speak about Arab-American stereotpyes in popular culture. As much as Nader inspired my leftishness during my flaming youth as a Green Party registrant, it is difficult not to unsee his whiteness, his maleness. He is the son of Lebanese immigrants, so he has some insight into this phenomenon of hatred, drummed not just by 9/11 but by decades upon decades of ignorance packaged and delivered directly to the American consumer. </p>

<p>Unlike most subway stations in New York, Roosevelt Avenue-74th Street is entered above ground. The building is triagular, squat and tiled, but oddly airy. The high walls are topped with an array of windows tinged in pink and blue. In the late-morning, the sun gleams through the windows and casts disco colors on the throng galloping down the stairs from the 7 Train to the express trains on the lower levels. The blank expressions and hasten gates are streaked with sunrise; they move steadily, rhthmically, like an opera chorus on an extravagant staircase. It is all a great performance,</p>

<p>I feel powerful when I bike in New York city streets, powerful and in control. It's an ideal state: half my mind in razor sharp focus, the other half dissolved in some philosophical adventure. I've been thinking a lot about will. "The faculty by which a person decides on an initiates action."  A strange use of the word "faculty," which calls forth an image of underpaid educators re-heating a burrito in that teachers lounge of the mind. When I think of will, I think of cancer, or dieting. The will to live, to pass a pizzeria without stopping. But will, it turns out, is something that will have to be conjured in order to complete the most mundane activity, albeit one that allows for a healthy existence. It is will that got me into the shower immediately after waking up, will that compelled me to finish a glass of water with my cup of coffee, will has me sitting here and writing to you at this hour, instead of being swallowed by Candy Crush Soda Saga. Will that allowed me only an hour of television yesterday, and to make rice and vegetables. </p>

<p>I came across my list of new years resolutions. The only one I've accomplished: "get internet."</p>

<p>Oh, those streets, those bridges, the roar of traffic and the clang of wheels. Red and yellow lights undulating around darkened parks and layers of scaffolding. I ride through the city and everything is a memory: that corner and that person, that restaurant and that scene, that night on that block. The memories reach out and touch me as I ride, like a congregation. </p>

<p>Laundry time is writing time. I'm next to the laundromat at the Colombian Bakery. Coffee cups are carved into backs of the wooden chairs, steam rising. Next to me, two woman. An elderly mother and her middle-aged daughter (perhaps). The elderly woman wears a t-shirt that says "This Beast is a Beast" in cursive. A teal-blue, crocheted headband holds back her dyed-red hair. She rubs her thighs as her daughter gesticulates widely and points her fingers. I couldn't tell you if their conversation is in Spanish because my hearing aid is turned off. The walls are painted in alternating shades of cream and orange, the wood is stained a shiny, dark coccoa. The women are now scraping their leftovers into aluminum take-away carriers. Frugal. I never do that. Leftovers cower in the back of my fridge, laying prey to mold spores. </p>

<p>The day is beautiful, perfect. I took a "mental health day." Yesterday, Sunday, was as bright and warm. The Copywriter and I walked 45 minutes to our brunch spot in Astoria, skirting the expressway on a broken up sidewalk. Tow trucks of endless varieties perched along the curb. We talked of nothing, as usual, old songs and dumb jokes. It is comfortable and we laugh. We do not have much sex. There is low sex drive between us, physiological and medication-induced. It's nice, not to be pawed when I want to die. There is a lot of cuddling, and kissing, and things teenagers do. We went to Socrates Sculpture Garden, but it was between exhibits. The only sculptures were in areas where the grass was being seeded, "do not cross" tape flapping like a snicker. There was a puppy, a khaki-colored little guy with pointy ears and wirey scruff. He jumped on my knees and I rubbed his back. </p>

<p>The Copywriter has become less needy. I am not sure if this is my influence, or if he simply needs me less, if I do not satisfy whatever it is needs satisfying. There is less badgering me about talking on the phone, meeting up at Quantum Leap for dinner. I had to put a stop to that. We were spending 3 days a week at least at Quantum Leap, a vegetarian restaurant with a sweet waitress who has been waiting on the Copywriter for 10 years. We order salmon and share the newspaper, like middle-aged couples do. </p>

<p>You Were Never Really Here is the new Lynne Ramsey film. Seven of us saw it last night at the Alamo. Responses were mixed. I appreciate the throw-backedness of it, the well-intentioned-contract-killer-with-ptsd of it, the perfect puzzle of a portrait, flashbacks artfully arranged to give you the picture of a man, a white man with a "murderous beard" as Shirley says. He loves his mother, hates himself, combats his past as a veteran, an FBI agent, an abused child, with fantasies of suicide. I told two people I relate to these fantasies, and they laughed. What else would they do? TK does not care for stories about white man, and I hear this. The white-man-ness of it throbbed like an ache. But Phoenix represents something other culture. The desire to die, to stop breathing, to escape yourself - I'd like to think that transcends culture. It certainly transcends gender.

<p>Two nights ago, I had dinner with MS - someone I used to work with. She cooks and makes quilts. Everything she does is amazing. She tends to be combative, and self-absorbed, or she used to be. She's 56 now. The job we both worked at laid her off, she was there 20 years. There was a time when we were part of a quad of female co-workers who spent Summer weekends in the Hamptons. The last on which she told us the story of her breakup in excruciating detail as we ate ice cream under a historic windmill. She could be a drag because she didn't drink and all there is to do around there is go to wineries. So we went to wineries and she moped around outside while three of us pretended to taste notes of pear. </p>

<p>Like so many female friends of mine, she is willful and demanding. I'm weak and acommodating; I need these people in my life to achieve some sort of balance. They can be a bit much at times, but I keep going back. A willful and demanding person can also exude a specific kind of warmth and appreciation. You know that with a willful and demanding person, you will be taken care of, kind of like a mob don and his neighborhood. </p>

<p>I've been on my meds about two weeks, you can tell by this rote, lifeless writing. It's all back to being vague and manageable. I do the same things, but don't feel the same way. Watching 10 hours of Netflix in a streak doesn't quite rack me with guilt, which means there is little motivation for me to stop doing it. What I've watched this month: Goliath, Absentia, Lore, Atypical, 2 seasons of New Girl, started the West Wing, and watched a bunch of movies like Moana, Seven, 45 Years, Dallas Buyers Club. That's just Netflix and Amazon alone, forget about Shudder and the goddamn movie theatre. Tonight, a bunch of us are meeting at the Alamo to watch the new Lynne Ramsay film. </p>

<p>It's true I've been watching things my whole life, my career is built upon watching things, living inside moving images. But I'm getting nothing out of these viewings, only the dregs of feeling that I don't get from my personal life. </p>

Curled up on the couch with a seltzer, feeling anxious and hateful. I'm not OK. I started my meds yesterday. I've been fucking up at work and now that I've been there 10 months, it is not forgiven. I can feel the respect of my colleagues dissolve into a single finger wagging. I don't know what to do. I'm just moving about my day, caring, being me, trying to make things happen, to get things done, and it's wrong. It's a BAD FIT. I don't think things through, I just move fast and furious, like a machine, fixing mistakes as I go along, or not fixing them.

<p>I gotta go, go soon. I sat down here, saw the log open and inviting. My cup of coffee is ready and willing. I still haven't started my meds, but I have them now. If I take them, will this compulsion to write cease? I must feed the cat, and will do that right...now...</p>

<p>...And, we're back. But I got little-to-nothing.</p>

<p>Later</p>

<p>Sometimes I sit in an overpriced hipster food court eating a slice of pizza and wonder what the fuck is happening. </p>

<p>Tuesday, I took a "mental health day" - I planned it a week ago. The planning was TIGHT. Another winter storm is predicted and we are out today as well, Wednesday. Two days in a row free from the sodium lights that fill the library with a diffused bloom. Free from the cocked eyebrow of THAT ONE. </p>

<p>I fell off my meds. The psychiatrist I work with insists on speaking to me once a month before she'll renew my prescription; this just won't do. I meant to go back on them, but then my mind became sharp. I'm raw, an exposed wire, a nervous thing easily offended. And I'm doing things, working hard, being vibrant. I have ideas, they snake before me like a garden path. It's been awhile, this clarity. But I also pass by the mirror and see fatness. The gun-to-my-head is back. I'm angry, irritated, paranoid. My anxiety takes front and center as if it is a very talented and precocious child. </p>

<p>But, at least so far, I'm handling it better. And I think I'm handling it better because I have an identity. I'm an archivist. I can say that with truth and confidence. I can say I'm an archivist to someone at a party and it is understandable yet also interesting. This is all I ever wanted to be: understandable yet also interesting. </p>

<p>Last week, I was mulling over this, how important identity is to our mental health as humans. Gender-identity being so central to our public discussions now. You'd think everyone could relate. You think it wouldn't be hard to understand. Don't we all struggle, at some point in our lives, against a perception of us that isn't true? </p>

<p>For the long weekend (President's Day), the Copywriter and I spent the weekend in Philadelphia, only two fights, one apparently doesn't count. Both started when I became impatient with his, shall we say, thoroughness. He was offended by that impatience as I suppose he should be. One of these moments was related to his fussiness about food and restaurant experiences, very singular to A. The other was more general to a thing that men, of any orientation or race, seem to do as a matter of course: fail to tell a story succicently. There is something in their upbringing, or their blood, that patently refuses to read their audience and adjust their act accordingly. Privledge because it presumes I want to listen to thair rambling, unkempt narrative that veers in various directions, disrespectful of 1) my time and 2) the point. </p>

There are parts of my job I don't like, and those parts were a little unruly this week. It was nice to end the day in the wide eyes of undergrads from the Pacific Northwest. </p>

<p>My phone is gone and I will not be able to afford another one until next month. I'm on my third book this week, Eileen Myles "Chelsea Girls." It's about lesbians, a thing I hope to not die having never been. </p>

<p> Marcel Meowceau, the kohl-eyed cat, nests in the soft skull of our regrettable brown couch. He was a guest for two weeks, then my newest teenage son. For most of his 11 years, he lived with an eldery woman in Ohio and a gregarious cat-brother. Her death was "hard on PeeWee" and he lives with me uneasily, without the comforting shadow of his gregarious cat-brother (living easily in some other home). I renamed him Marcel, disrepectful of the dead, respectful of mimes. </p>

<p>I turned 40 last week. Friends and I fled to the Madonna Inn in San Luis Obispo. Weather perfect. We climbed Bishops Peaks, drank sugary cocktails in a hot tub, fed in the town's best vegetarian restaurant, watched Elephant Seals mate, gathered stones at the beach, ate cake on the boardwalk, drove through the mountains as the sky exploded into apopcalytpic colors. We took the red-eye back Sunday night, I caught food poisoning and spent most of the flight vomiting, and with diarrhea. The spicy, airport meal seared my asshole, inflamed the back of my throat. The worried look of flight attendents as they forced opened the door, "you didn't hear us knocking?" I was wheeled out in a wheelchair, all the way to the taxi-stand, changing pushers once. TK rode with me back to the apartment. She is worried about me but tired of worrying about me. She is my mother, she is not my mother, she never asked to anything other than my friend. What have I done for her lately? </p>

<p>Home, I stayed. Marcel, alone for three days, intermittently stretched or curled against my thigh. I finished "God of Small Things" and started "The Fledging" and at some point realized I left my phone at the airport.</p>

<p>Quickly, now. There should be no procrasinating. There is some side work I have to finish before I leave for the 8 hour job, then return to cook a dinner for Adam (my idea). <p>

<p>Sunday night, while in still in DC, we went to the Smithsonian's museum of African Art. They have a large exhibit of media works by contemporary artists. We moved through the hall of screens silently. Three panels showed people cut out from red crepe paper, dissolving in water. The effect was a dystopic, bloody, brutal landscape swirled away by some apocalypic force, the bodies defiant and strong as the red dissolves and they are in the gray, and in the clear. The work is called <i>About to Forget</i> by a South African Artist named Bernie Searle.<p>

<p>Then, we walked to the Martin Luther King, Jr. memorial to pay our respects. Such a terrible idea for a memorial. King is monolithic, sterile, <i>white</i>. He was a community organizer and his memorial should be community-minded, but what do I know. A group of Muslim girls in headscarves asked me to take their picture. They giggled and shivered in the freezing wind, huddled at the foundation of King, paternal with his arms crossed and his face adroit, his steely gaze staring out over their heads like a disapointed father.</p>

<p>I don't think I'm going to get any work done here.</p>

<p>Friday in New York was warm and wet, the tops of buildings dissolving into a silvery fog, an effect at night that looks like magic. New York is still magical, still unique and spirited, even in the hands of its corporate captors; I still believe.</p>

<p>At 4pm, I left work for the long weekend that celebrates Martin Luther King, Jr. I like to celebrate by putting his picture up on my Facebook Profile and revisitng <i>Letter from a Birmingham Jail</i></p>

<blockquote>We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.</blockquote>

<p>It is the natural way of things for those who have found success in a particular system to work towards keeping that system in place. For socialism to work, we must rid ourselves of the sociopaths by fighting for a system that doesn't reward them. </p>

<p>But do I still take share Dr. King's stance on non-violence campaigns? He also said in these letters, to paraphrase, "there are four steps in any non-violent campaign: confirm an injustice, negotiate, self-purify, direct action." But we are now desensitized to non-violence methods of social change. Protests are nuisances that block traffic. They are noisy things for people like me to participate in on their way home from work. There can be power in a protest, but only when it is on a massive, 10-million+ scale. There is a dark heart growing inside of me. One that wants our leadership dead, buried, shoved onto boats and pushed out into the open sea. Castro and Popper have the right idea. We can't tolerate the intolerant. We must embrace this paradox. How to do this non-violently? Lawmaking is restrictive for the most of us who live and want to live life peacefully. We shouldn't have to be told by the law to behave ethically. And yet, clearly we have to. Or, we can thin out a certain gene pool. </p>

<p>It's Sunday now, and I'm in SJ's apartment. They are off to their dance class and I am alone with the rabbit. Yesterday, we stumbled between distilleries in the bright cold that seized the post-industrial blocks of the NE section of town. We were happy, I think, quickly drunk. They told me they haven't spoken with their Republican friends since the election. I had a cocktail called "To Norway, America is a Shithole." The young man that served us tastings of Gin and Vermouth was a bearded, pasty cherub in hornrimmed glasses. We took a Lyft back to the apartment at 4pm and napped. I dreamed of men, it was a happy dream. Jeremy woke me up, he was wearing his coat and shoes. Time to go to "the wharf" and see something called a "Super Art Fight." </p>

Watched <i>Logan</i> and keep thinking about it. I'm not sure what calls me to it, the girl, perhaps. I am often drawn to fiery tweens. Throw in a handsome, world-weary anti-hero and a decent plot, this is the stuff young me is made of. In the news: 200,000 Salvadorans are to be deported. They arrived here in the early 2000s after an Earthquake destroyed the country. The Trump administration wants them all to go back, and giving them until September 2019 to do so. He is doing this because this is the only way his administration knows how to quickly add jobs to the labor market. The lack of humanity that lives in the heart of Trump and his minions is deplorable indeed.

<p>Sunday. I've been dreaming quite a bit lately, or remembering my dreams. Two nights ago, I dreamt I was visiting a zoo with A. How I got to this zoo is barely recalled, some kind of road trip through a Missouri-like landscape: single-lane road, crude, wire fences, patches of snow floating on an ocean of dead, yellow grass. But at the zoo, it was warm and lush. Between two gallery-type buildings was a large watering hole with giraffes wading up to their necks and hippos buoyant. A path snaked around the watering hole, the other side of it an expanse of lawn dotted with picnicking families. We entered one of the buildings and drifted from exhibit to exhibit. Suddenly, I see J, my first boyfriend. He's exactly as I remember, as young, as scruffy, with the hood of his sweatshirt over his head. He has a backpack and a half-smile. He's walking swiftly, with purpose, as if he works there and he's running late. My heart pounded with fear/love/nostalgia/dread, I tell A we must leave immediately.</p>

<p>I'm at the Copywriter's apartment now. He's next to me on the couch, practicing guitar. I heated up a can of cold coffee. It's 3 degrees or some shit.</p>

<p>I'm halfway through <i>The Book of Joan</i> by Lidia Yuknavitch, a futuristic re-telling of the Joan of Arc story. The writing is vivid if the plot isn't, requiring the reader to fill in the intentional gaps by linking parallel story lines. I'm making a conscientious effort to read in the moment, to visualize the space station a colony of wealthy earthlings live on after their planet is destroyed, the wall-less prison where convicts are held behind invisible electrified walls, and Joan herself, a black-haired androgynous thing, like the vampire child in "Let the Right One In," except confident, determined, and infused with magic. I check out this book from the public library only because there was a positive quote on it from Roxane Gay. Sucker that I am.</p>

<p>Today, I will attempt some form of exercise, and finish the contract work, and maybe go to the museum with the Copywriter.</p>

  <p>Snowstorm. The windows in my bedroom aren't sealed properly and I woke up to flakes of show tufting into the room with every blast of wind. We can hear the wind now, in TK's room, it sounds like the ocean. NYU called a snow day. I'm in my polka-dot pajamas and my cervical brace. M is stuck in Long Island and I may miss her while she's in town. I took melantonin for the first time and sleep came gently. Last night, the grocery store was packed with people; the woman behind be bought a single tub of chocolate-hazelnut gelato. I bought mandarins and hummus. </p>

  <p>LA is still on fire, SF had an earthquake this morning, Trump and Bannon are in some kind of public squabble. No one is sure we can mentally handle another 3 years of this awful reign. I can only hope Trump's promise to "drain the swamp" will occur inasmuch as it destroys the Republican party.

<p> I bought a cervical brace, a cheap one. I'm lying in bed, my neck wrapped in foam. I look like a rare bird in mating season. A week of stomach virus, followed by a week of PMS, followed by a week of an upper respiratory infection and some kind of sever neck strain. The Copywriter and I saw "I, Tonya" today. What I got out of it was an appreciation for Tonya Harding's moxie, athleticism, and self-possession, and enjoyed the energy of the filmed ice sequences, Allison Janny's divine crustiness, a bird perched on her shoulder nipping at her ear as she drinks whiskey and shits on her daughter. It's good timing to re-discover Tonya Harding. The #metoo movement is reaching back to these women we were told were villianesses, the ones who were "hard to work with," or "jealous," or "cunts," "bitches," and what-have-you, and exploring some other version of the truth.</p>

<p>The Copywriter and I had a good day. There are days when I can barely tolerate him, and days like today, when I almost (almost) think I love him. Hormones, all of it. </p>

<p>I woke up sick and canceled everything. I spent the day drinking tea, trying to work, finishing up the Strain, a 600 page vampire novel I started only yesterday (I'm now watching the tv series). TK stoped by around 9:30pm and we talked until the New Year rang. She feels older than me, learned in places I won't go. She's an adult, and I'm arrested. I have nothing to offer her, no advice, no wisdom, no safety, no support, nothing that she doesn't already have or know. I still love being with her, talking with her. I think she still likes being around me, but sometimes I don't know, sometimes I feel like a sick relative she is obligated to care for. We talked about our fathers, our love life, the bad TV we watch, our goals for 2018 (cook more, write more, etc.). We talked about our grandmothers, their frailty, she said with her grandmother, she feels a curtain closing. I said out loud what I had thought just a few days ago when I helped my grandmother with her seatbelt. Who was going to help me with my seatbelt? </p>

<p>These vampires and zombie shows, why do we love them so? Because our innate cowardices are justified only when faced with a clear and present evil? Is it only the weakest, spineless amongst who love horror? </p>

The vibe is somewhat relaxed, as holidays at the airport go. The odd flyer wears a Santa hat. A sleeping man in a holiday sweater is splayed in his seat as if he was smashed into it with a mallet. Ear buds, ear phones; long gazes hanging on the boarding signs. Delta has iPads secured to long tables in the waiting area. At the end of each table is a column lamp shedding amber light into the harsh fluorescent overcast . I appreciate the effort.

<p>It’s the day after three days in bed with the stomach flu. I feel like a ghost. I haven’t had coffee, alcohol, or very much food in what seems like a long time. I feel blank, not like slate, but like smoke, like the kind that billows from the odd chimney outside my window, fast moving and making faces, grinning, gasping, mocking my mood. </p>

<p>TK and I have scheduled a time on Monday to discuss whether we will ever travel together again. My little problem effectively ruined the trip to New Orleans. It’s hard to think about the trip fondly. I wonder what I could possible say to her. I’ve run over the conversation we are likely to have in my mind. They’ve all accepted I have emotional problems, what they cannot accept is that I am handling it in the best of ways. I don’t know if this is true or not. </p>

<p>What am I, really? A depressive? Or, perhaps, do I have a kind of Munchausen’s where I make myself depressed to earn pity? Love is two things: pity and praise.  I feel so dark and evil right now. Am I?  </p>

6:47am</p>

<p>We got back from New Orleans two nights ago. Friday, the day before my period, I had a melt down, at first internally, and then openly 24 hours later on a balcony overlooking the French Quarter and extending from a vampire-themed bar that requires a password to get in. The trigger was Shirley claiming, suddenly, that she did not want to spend her money on a ghost tour, which was the only thing I said I wanted to do on our trip. This was after I watched her spend three days dropping around $40-$50 dollars for every meal. Then, she tried to shame me out of it, more or less stating a haunted tour is hokey and stupid. Last year, she did something similar, claiming she was too broke to go to the Woman’s March, after I had already purchased a plane ticket to be with her and TK in DC. TK sided with her both times, effectively choosing her over me. My long, emotional memory linking, connecting, latching on to the pattern. TK says, ‘you are taking it too personally,’ but the pattern personal. I don’t think it’s me that should look inward, I think it is them. But I am crazy, depressed, and self-absorbed, so what do I know? There were tears, and yelling, and outpouring on the balcony while young people screamed their love of life from the ancient streets, but I said nothing I actually wanted to say in the way I actually wanted to say it, because it would be abusive, I am an abuser. I’m told “it’s better to get it all out,” but they don’t know. </p>

<p>When I left for California, they became close friends. In the process, I lost them both.</p>

<p>The biking went well, for the most part. I learned Newark is an expansive city, geographically, relatively; I could have crossed the length of Manhattan in less time. I biked across two vertical lift bridges, one across the Hackensack River and the other crossing the Passaic. These bridges aren’t as old as bridges go, they were built in the mid-20th Century, but they dilapidated and disingenuous, like discarded pieces of iron placed in a museum and called art. The pedestrian paths were the exact width of two human feet, sandy-colored and shielded by long grasses. Empty bags of Cheetoes, styrofoam cups, I wobbled on the thin path between the guardrail and a sunny, sparkling view of a landscape that probably hasn’t changed much since the bridges were built:  another bridge, more water, smokestacks, telephone poles, trucks the size of dinosaurs, careening, bellowing, shedding black smog. </p>

I’m gearing up to bike to Elizabeth, NJ to stay over at TK’s family house. I have to shower soon. I had yellow roses delivered to their house. The website said it would cost $40 and it cost $60. I don’t make enough to be that generous, wtf. I’ve made my bed, I’ve had coffee. I’ll bike to Herald Square and take the PATH train to Newport Pavonia.

<p>It’s turned cold. I’m fostering two kittens and neither compare to my Paddington. They are devoid of personality. Their tails and movements are synchronized like twins in a horror movie. They cuddle with me only as a matter of competition between each other. They’ve been with me two months now; they have to go. </p>

<p>The Copywriter. By the end of this month, we’ll have seen each other four months. As long as I’m on my medication, I enjoy his company. When it happens that I am not, he chafes like scratchy sweater. Do I love him? I don’t know. Probably not, but I don’t love in healthy ways. I have associated love with obsession, longing; grappling for their attention, respect, and validation. When those things are given to me freely, it annoys me. I worry he won’t assimilate with my friends as easily as Robot Man did, Robot Man the pleaser. The Copywriter is not a pleaser, he will not be paying for anyone’s meals or fixing their computer or moving their furniture. He is, as I’ve asked for, “just mean enough so I don’t feel guilty.” </p>

<p>But he is not so mean to me. He buys me little things that show he thinks about me when I’m not there. He shares my love of wandering around bookstores and record stores. He’ll watch anything I want to watch, eat anything I want to eat, give me as much space as I need, doesn’t talk about his job endlessly (although he said once he starts he won’t stop). He’s got a temper, and this worries me, the screaming, ranty kind, road rage and impatience. But I also like his impatience, it keeps me in check.</p>

<p>Red's apartment is at the end of Dixon Place, an old pencil factory gutted and reborn as three blocks of vintage-industrial condominiums. The resurrection occurred when James and I were living nearby, on Newark and Monmouth in the late 1990’s. I remember the smashed windows and dusty light beams of abandonment. I remember James sardonic smile when the first pair of curtains were hung. I remember the track of low-income shopping available between Monmouth and Grove Street, now a gentrified thoroughfare of overprice restaurants and ice cream shops. Helen’s Pizza is still there, so is the cheap all-purpose store C.H. Martin, its smell of mildew and cheap perfume a fixture in my memory.  </p>

<p>In a half hour, I will leave. I will go back to Queens and do a little laundry, a little writing with TK. I’ll come back and give Red's cats their medicine and their meals. Then, I’ll go back out and toast to my friend RB, aka George Girl, the last friend from college I still hang out with. He has a girlfriend now, but I do think about him sometimes. Why not? We are the same age, both reasonably attractive, fucked up in the same fucked up ways. It’s hard not to associate him with JC, though, and their odd relationship, singing songs based on newspaper articles when they should have been setting up lights. So when i see Rob, any attraction that may or may not be there is mitigated by the enveloping haze of nostalgia. </p>

I’ve been in Jackson Heights not two weeks and I feel at home again, comfortable, lived in, ready for love, ready for the rest of my life. Settled never felt good to me, but it does now. I know things. I know where I want to live and I live there. I know where I want to work and I work there. There’s no more getting there, at least not for the time being.

A fan whirs. I just watched a movie. I’m drinking La Croix. It’s all very good. I started the job for the first time today. My office, and it is my own, is a big, windowless box.

Letting her go is painful, it moves me to tears nearly every time I think of it. Her spirit is so beautiful, so sweet. I’ve walked many dogs, met many, she’s the best. </p>

<p>I’ve been off meds for about three weeks now, unintentionally. I feel more creative and awake, but also more worried, and anxious. All it will take is one trigger to send me down the depression spiral; I can’t be like that at my new job, this is my last stop. </p>

<p>There’s a hand-written sign that says “Garlic Fresh and Pickled.” I think we are listening to Portishead, or something like them. I’m in the back seat. MC is driving. VC is either sleeping or pre-occupied with his phone. 152 is a two-lane road that connects 101 with 5, the fasted route to LA. We are going to Disneyland. It’s black and wet outside, cars lumbering behind each other like slaves. No cell phone service. </p>

<p>I’m a machine. </p>

<p>And with a hug on the corner of York and 20th, he was off. Clung to him, the remnants: three tote bags full of text books on digital and video technology. I’m saddened he didn’t leave them with me. I was sure he’d be generous in at least that way. But he’s not the generous sort. He’s the charming and lovable sort. Two and a half years of intensive longing, the kind that initiated a breakup and sent me to the psych ward twice, dissolved in a glass of disappointment and envy. I will keep him talking to me. He is obliging, but he won’t always be. “They don’t think about us when we aren’t there.” </p>

<p>To will myself out of suicide fantasies, I have panic attack fantasies. In both, I am pitied. I've long known that I conflate pity with love: this is my mother's doing, and her mother's doing. </p>

<p>I have lost sleep over my presentation. Since Monday I have had maybe 10 hours of sleep. Today we rehearsed for each other in the Blue Room. B spent a few hours on his opening and it is brilliant. Mine is terrible. The end.</p>

<p>You think you've experienced lonliness, then you and BT are stuck in a car in angry silence for three hours and you've never felt more alone. He's speeding, passing everything in sight, hip-hop thudding. You are staring out the window, the side window, so the back of your head is in his face. It goes on like that until you are at a rest stop. He goes into McDonalds to eat, knowing full well you can't eat there, and just scarfs his food in front of you, never asks if you are hungry, never apologizes. You continue to say nothing, because you can't think of the perfect thing to say. You spend two of those three hours searching and searching for the thing that will solve the problem and end in laughter. Then, you give up and lean the seat back as far as in will go, turn your back to him, and quietly, as quietly as possible, sob. You think he might have said your name once, but it's impossible to tell over the music which seems to crescendo in increments, as if he is turning up the volume in step with the rising insensity of the mood. KZ taught that helical scan tape should have 40 grams of tension to move correctly through the transport. What happens at 40lbs? Madonna's "Hung Up" makes your feet twitch. That's something. That's the only thing.</p>

<p>It's 9pm, you are parked in front of your apartment. You say thank you, and he says that you shouldn't come into work tommorrow. </p>

<p>You can't get your key in the door, you poke and prod, then a man yells, it's not your door. </p>

<p>You fall to your knees and wail. You smack yourself in the head until you see colors. You want to call a hospital, but you can't find your phone, where is it? It's nowhere. The squalid, flea-ridden , studio apartment, the empty bank account, the ugliness, the oldness, the deafness, the sadness, the deep longing unreturned, the weak mother, the angry father, and a life of endlessly searching for a co-dependent caretaker. You are a parasite looking for a host, an invertebrae, a blood-sucking vagrant, a flea. They can't get rid of you. They'll drive away in their rented Mazda, a man-purse full of expensive eye creams tumbling in the back seat, but they can't shake you. You are attached. </p>

<p>8:37pm</p>

<p>Polishing off this wine. Properly drunk and alone for the first time in a week. I spent an hour talking to TK via Hangout. She got me through the day. I called the Psych ward at the SF General Hospital. The woman on the phone? You could hear her filing her nails. "Well, what's going on with you?" she asked, after I inquired into the protocols of checking into the facility. Oh, I'm checking myself into a psych ward, what's going on with you? I think this, but do not say. She recommends a place in Oakland. I start googling. Apparently, there are Yelp reviews of city-run psych wards. They tell some tales. People put in beds next to pans of urine.</p>

Paradise, California<br>
7:42 am</p>

<p>Ponderosa Gardens Motel. Our room thinks it is a cottage, an escape into wildflower wall paper and faux-wood blinds. I shouldn't be writing here, I'll be teased. A four hour drive through cotton-mouth hills, the occasional smell of smoke. A drought-colored palette: beige and beige. </p>

<p>8:25pm</p>

<p>We spent 10 hours at Ken Zin's, though I shouldn't count the 1/2 hour we were lost in a thick of trees. We crossed a bridge into Magalia, and everything changed. Pine trees shot out of the ground, a fine mist scattered across deep canyon. A portal into upstate New Jersey, where James lived, and I almost lived. His face continues to hang like a spector, like the terrible head of Oz. </p>

<p>Before, we ate at a roadside cafe called Jaki's. House-like, with a wall of windows that leaked misty light over a table of middle-aged fat men with beards and tattoos: bikers. I had a hankering to talk to them. To sit down and find any excuse to laugh. They laugh easy, those men, they anger easy too. They are loud and give no fucks. But I'm with Ben, who behaves as if he would rather be anywhere else in the world than sitting across from me. This carries over from last night. We drove up and down Skyway, the dark, winding thoroughfare through town, looking for a place to eat. He's picky, but seems to want me to choose. I don't want to be responsible for dining below his standards. I'll eat it off the floor if it is vegetarian. </p>

<p>We end up at a place called The Wine Room. It's a strange hybrid of a sports bar and a date place. They are oddly out of cheese. He's tense and dismissive. I'm confused. We usually get on so well, as comfortable as siblings. And here it comes: Why is he not talking to me, why is he averting his eyes? Am I embarrsing him? Did I piss him off? Is he just preoccupied? It is times like these that he is like a straight man, the cool distant. I excuse myself to the bathroom and burrow my forhead into the closed door. Is it chemical? Is it real? </p>

<p>Ken lives in a house deep in a forest, with a gravel driveway and a giant army-regulation generator. His dog, Major, came bounding towards us, barking and growling, protecting his turf. He's an aging, overweight Boxer with drooping eyes; his underbite is a row of tiny, white teeth floating in pink flesh.</p>

<p>All day we spent in his workshop, learning how to repair 1/2" open reel decks. Ben's behavior towards me wasn't changing. Does he not want to talk to me because he has to repeat himself? They line up, the people in my life who have to suffer the indignity of having to repeat themselves, of having to repeat the words of others to me.</p>

<p>There's coffee in the French press. "Tweaky but thin," said B, describing the French press he made for the AV Surgery class on Friday. I freaked out on Friday. Oh wait, I told you that already. It's been on my mind. TK was on IM when I was whacking myself in the preservation suite. I told her what was happening. She told me to breath. I left my phone in the suite and went to the bathroom, splashed water on my face, and went back to class. Dealt. TK didn't know what happened to me and called Brittany at the front desk. She said it was "imperative" that she find me and tell her I am OK. Brittany walked by the Green Lab and stood in the door frame, catching my eye with a bemused half smile.</p>

<p>Yesterday, B, BR, and I ended up at the same TRX class. I sort of cut her out of a 3-way conversation to ask B questions about work. I tend to do this with people I can't hear, the soft spoken, the quietly casual. It's not right, but also, fuck them, they can make friends with whoever they want. </p>

<p>The check from NYU was invalidated after 180 days. Maybe I can get them to send another one. Have to try. Money and food are all that is on my mind - and sex. Things I don't have. I spent most of the 3-day weekend figuring out my finances for the next month. Paypal will not finalize the payment on the sale of my signed, Hunter S. Thompson book until the 23rd, and then it will take another 3-5 days to withdraw into my bank account. I cashed in my credit card points for $109, but that won't come in until another 5 days. I wrote to the financial advisor of my pension plan and requested a withdrawel that my 75 year old version is sure to regret. </p>

<p>Yesterday, I was slapping myself in the Preservation Suite. I don't remember thinking about it, it just happened. I was sobbing hysterically and then, whack. As involuntary as if I had scratched my nose. Later, there were beers, but I left after one. I ran home, as much as one can run with the BART in the way. I went into the bathroom and beat my head with a plastic water bottle. It didn't do much. I'm too afraid to really hurt myself. Or, rather, the vision is so potent that the reality isn't necessary. I'm lonely and angry and going mad. B says, "You need to eat lunch."</p> 

<p>I'm watching American Horror: Freakshow on my phone. I'm overdrawn and out of food. There's some rice congealing on my stove. Earlier, I fell to the floor and rearranged my filing cabinet. I found a check for $150 from last summer that had never been cashed. At eight o'clock and night I started walking towards the nearest BOA ATM to cash it - a 1/2 hour walk. I listened to Morcheeba the whole way and occasionally took a picture. </p>

<p>Listening to BBC World News while applying makeup. Syria is a problem. The pope came and went. We flew to DC last Sunday, gave our presentations on Monday. Three people showed up (I think six made reservations). The city was gray. Halfway through my presentation, I excused myself on the pretense of washing my hands. I played our clipreel and left. But I just sat on the toilet and breathed hard. I returned after a minute or two and bumbled through the second half. We served wine and cheese after and I drank too much. Then, we went out to dinner with Ben's parents, and that's a whole nother story. <p>

The reality of it is - I didn't get up until 6:30am, then made breakfast and lunch and only just now sitting down with my coffee. It's the Bauhuas brand that Sam Long brought me back from Seattle. He had a birthday party last week, but I called out sick. He called out sick on my birthday. Neither of us were really sick. All the girls (and boys) like Sam, but his adam's apple is like the head of a fetus seaching for a way out.  He abandoned us and he lies. I mean, he's nice, but he lies. 

I should probably spend the next fifteen minutes working on all the things I said I was going to do - but I could also tell you about this dream I had about 1/2". 

Later...

Drunk again! Going away party for Aylara at Dear Mom. I don't know where it is. 16th and Mission. It's September 11th. I watched it all go down.

I'm a little drunk from 2 glasses of wine. I'm watching The New Girl and embarrassed by how much I enjoy it. Lauren's last day in the Preservation Office is tomorrow. Next week, she begins as a Development Associate. Across the hall and hundred miles away. I feel as if I've grown fat and huge, melting skin and flab and flesh. Alpha hydroxy on the face. Redness. The stink of old is becoming impossible to hide. Don't get used to it. Youth is just another addiction, that's all  

Tomorrow I will do this: I will get up at 5am. I will make coffee and work on these things: language for Rachel's proposal; final touches on the Salesforce email; an email to Kim asking her if we were still on for the Workshop; update the Salesforce campaign with emails from Ben/Lauren. I will make breakfast. At 7:30am I will shower and get ready for work. Stab the cat. I will leave at 8am, get to work at 9am. I will bring clothes to workout in.

I've been in Sunset all week. Joe and his new girlfriend are on a roadtrip to Denver; they come back tomorrow. I have spent most of the weekend in his bed. I have a cold, but also to take solace in the repeated visage of slitting my own throat. I would like to disappear, or start over, and death is my best chance of that. This is teen talk. Fuck you, I don't care. Ben emailed me a non-apology; he is forgiven. He wears a Lou Reed t-shirt to work and I am jealous - he says it was his first eBay purchase...in high school. I'm given a $10,000 raise. He and I make the same amount. He is still the manager and I am not. His concern for my well-being touches and confuses.

Siouxsie and the Banshees greatest hits on repeat. A montage of my dog and I asleep on each other in various arrangements. That is the weekend.

Can you believe I am still angry? As Vincent would say, it's friggin' hilarious. I didn't stay at work long yesterday. I met Megan and Vincent at Jennifer Lieberman's house in Oakland. She's a friend of Susan, who is betrothed to Toisha, an artist who worked with us at Barnes and Noble. Susan is in town to "support" Jennifer as she goes through a divorce. Jennifer lives in a large, rambling house in Grand Lake with two boys, eight and nine. The eight year old asked me "why do you talk like that?" I hated him in an instance. 

Six of us circled Lake Merritt and ended up at a Taco Truck. Someone left a box of "free" things and I picked up an ancient copy of "Lust for Life" and a House of Pain cassette tape. The kid I hate said he was born in 2007 and I hated him even more. People say they don't notice my speech issues, but they are liars. I hate this kid for telling the truth. Now I know for sure and I can't unknow. 

Tomorrow, I will do this. I will get up at 5am and run. I will run and my body will be amazing becaues nothing else is, not my voice, not my ears, not my mouth, not my eyes, not my face, but my body? My body will trump them all. Suddenly, I don't regret wasting time worry aobut my body. It's the only thing that has held up this far.

<p>I woke up this morning still angry. The things that are wrong with me. Why can't I think about something constructive, and not my ego, wounded by someone I'm unfortunately attracted too. This is bullshit. I dyed my hair. I'm finishing coffee. I'll leave for work soon, but not before stabbing the cat. My plan today is to go to work and put tapes in the oven. Then, I will finish up what I need to do of Doris Chase and put everything on the drive for QC. I have to create a suite of access files for CW and LN so they can see if they work with Final Cut Pro 6. And I have to send J.T. a sample 10-bit file. </p>

<p>It's Friday. I called out on my very first sick-day-out-of-spite. I also have legit PMS; only partly why I don't want to speak to Ben. He can morph from sweetheart to prick in a flick of a tongue. He thinks I take too long to do things, that my standards are too high, that I choose perfection at the expense of efficiency. He says these things in front of our contractor on my 12th straight day of 8-10 hour workdays, which just also happened to be the morning that my ex-boyfriend gave me $1,000 so I could pay my rent on time this month. I thought we were better friends than that. We are not. I'm no longer dreaming, but something lingers. I still grapple for his approval, satisfying the dregs of a squashed desire. I pouted all day in the preservation suite. Didn't look him in the eye, barely responded to his IMs, left early, then called out today. It has gotten me nowhere. He hasn't apologized. He knows what is going on, but he just thinks I'm being oversensitive and I'll get over it - if he thinks anything at all. The level of care is not equitable. I'm working on it. It's difficult to roll back caring for someone, but as long as he keeps being a little prick, I just might get there.</p>

<p>10:40pm
Languished in bed for too long. Then, I went out. With Joe's emergency money, I bought $100 worth of things I needed: groceries, kitty litter, a toilet brush, wine. I bought RAID packets for the ants. I killed a Daddy Long Legs in the shower. He wouldn't die as quickly as the ants, but when he did, he flattened and crumpled like a cartoon, the air in his delicate steps deflated. I felt bad. </p>

<p>I rode my bike through Berkely tonight. There's a full moon hanging in dirty brown clouds. There are corners crowded with lights and college students, but farther into the hills the streets are dark and jammed with million dollar homes, adobe walls and slatted roofs, gardens overflowing with fairy tale fauna. I saw two deer. I thought they were someone's unleashed greyhounds. </p>

12:47 pm</p>

<p>On Friday morning, Joe IMs and asks if I could watch Tasha over labor day weekend. Of course, I say, exclamation marks. Then he says he is dating someone and taking the trip with her. Unsurprising. I suspected he would get on that right away. I made him feel unwanted, he told me this in our last days. He said this in hopes that I would change my behavior. Instead, I left. When one feels unwanted, one will grapple for the nearest recess in the wall. </p>

<p>He's been difficult about our dog. He'd prefer that I never see her again. He comes home and sees my dirty dishes, the remnants of me, and this pains or enrages him or both. He does not miss me. I don't believe it for a second that he feels the undercurrent. I don't know what else to call it. The thing, the connection, love, bond, but I prefer undercurrent, because that is what it is: a steady motion that anchors the chaos on surface. Or maybe, since I'm a preserver of analog video, I should call it a subcarrier. </p>

<p>I'm a skeptic, so talking about this shit makes me feel ill - but I believe in it. I believe people can connect from across the room without speaking a word to each other. Jesus, do I live for it. I'm addicted to the undercurrent. For 7.5 years I lived without it. Longer, even, if you discount everyone back to TK. It's there with B, but it won't lead to romance. This fact has shattered my faith in the soothsaying properties of the undercurrent. It's just a thing and no more. A thing that feels safe, secure, but thrilling all the same. Unlike everyting else in the world. </p>

<p>EP is in town. He's in a hotel somewhere in Nob Hill. It looks like I'll be staying over in his room tonight to work on some of the consulting he's doing for my employer. I'm a little creeped, but not completely: he's awkward and engaged to be married. Because of this soiree, I'm going in to work late this morning. My cat is lurking around my chair, intent on my lap. I'm crouched and making it impossible for him. He annoys me so much. </p>

<p>I would be gone now except I left my work keys at Joe's last night. I apparently also left the oven on. To be in his shoes, hating his ex, but tolerating her just enough to let her see their dog three days a week, to come home and find dirty dishes in the sink and the oven on and the TV set to play "Drop Dead Diva."</p>

<p>In one of the last truly memorable dreams, I dreamt I was walking along a train track buried deep in an mountainous, African landscape. With me ,or coming towards me, I can't remember which, were two Muslim girls. A 19th century steam engine comes barreling down the tracks sudden, inexplicable; it's chimney smoking in cartoonish puffs like in Buster Keaton's "The General". In an attempt to avoid us, it derailed, tipped and landed on its side in a flurry of red dust. Before I woke up, I remember feeling not fear or relief, but just simple, mild confusion, like I had put on my shoes wrong. <p>

<p>After meeting my neighbor, Mekone, who poured boiling on the ants outside our door, I ordered a book about Eritrea. I'm reading about the narrow-gauge railroad build by Italian colonists, how it is still in operation, particulary between the key cities of Asmara and Massawa. The pictures look like my dreams. Steam and iron lost in great hills of rock and red. Village children standing dangrously near the tracks. Heat. Dust. A blue sky jittering like picture instability in the suns rays. <p>

<p>It is curious and thrilling to see a dream in a photograph.</p>

<p> JS's birthday was Friday. I sent him an email wishing him a happy birthday, he thanked me. That was all. Every year, his birthday was such a hassle because he refused to decide what he wanted to do, and I refused to bully him into doing something I wanted to do simply because he was indecisive, so we ended up doing nothing, or something dumb, like swimming at Chelsea Piers.<p>

<p>Since the great B reveal, I have been a little boy crazy. There is a man who looks like a mini-Dathrokian warlord, and another who is like JS with a handle-bar mustache. The former is someone to fuck, the latter is someone to marry. I want both, but probably the fuck first. Neither of them are as loud or as fun as B. Neither I feel like I've always known.</p>

<p>On Thursday, we held a Q&A session that no one showed up for. They blamed the Republican debates, but I blame ourselves. We tweeted twice but otherwise told no one. So we set up the room, the three of us at a table, the ED and IT, and we finished off the bottle of wine that was meant for guests while L and I sang Sondheim duets into the microphone.</p>

<p>Time to finish up this cup of coffee and race to Mint Plaza. I'm finally meeting up with L and her boy. Should be totally awkward.</p>

<p>Almond Butter is overrated; I learned that this morning. It's loose and lumpy like a thick soup. I suppose if you have peanut allergies, you would be grateful. I am not.</p>

<p>My Charlotte rams her head into my arm like a cat. She demands nuzzles. She hugs back. Her eyes are thick with acquiesces. We adore each other. </p>

<p>The 1/2" decks are in working order again. As much as they can be. B drove up to get them from KZ on Monday. I'd like to plow through the collection from Wisconsin Center for Film and Television. That's probably what I'll do today. That and work on a powerpoint presentation for the Q&A tomorrow.</p>

<p>I can watch Game of Thrones on my phone. This can be problematic on the BART when the whores are naked and licking noses. The show is beginning to bore me. Nothing puts me to sleep faster than a battle scene. A stronger actress should have been cast for the Queen. Lena Heady is beautiful and then what? It's a difficult part, I'll give her that. The actress has to convince us her cruelty, bitterness, and incestuous behavior are all done for survival for herself and her children. Anti-heroines are not a common archetype, but god knows they should be.</p>

<p>I should split. </p>

<p>Currently scarfing a bowl of cheese-covered cauliflower, this after a mushroom-and-onion laden grilled cheese sandwich. So much cheese. I ate half a bell pepper for lunch as was mocked.

On [Dog's name] Thursday, I take the train to see her, unchain my bike back to Oakland, nearly always forgetting my bike helmet. I ride to the Embarcardero BART stop, hop on and off again at West Oakland. There, in the dark, empty, industrial gloom of the notoriously "unsafe" West Oakland, I ride bareheaded. </p>

<p>This place is filthy. The army of ants marched their relentless march from the crack in the yard door to the crack in my door, mauling my cat's food bowl. The building manager, appears to be soft in the head. Oh no, she says, I'll give you the name of the exterminator. As if it's my responsiblity to let the exterminator in the back door. She's SEEN the ants. She KNOWS where they are...yet, the disenguity of pretending like they are still coming from within my apartment: ugh.</p>

<p>Then there's the cat's litter, stinking up the place. I hate him. He has me trapped in his stench and his illness. Even the $400 litter robot can't keep the hot mix of perfume and piss stink up my nostrils. I could surrender him to SPCA, or I could call this Safe Haven place that cares for ill and senior pets. This all sounds cruel to you, I know. But I can't love him, and I can't pay for him, and the stink of shit and piss and the crawl of insects around his food bowl. I've tried everything. I'm living in penniless filth because of this animal. And I love animals, which is why I want to pass him on. He needs love and care and I have none to give him. Like J.</p>

<p>Yesterday was meant to be more productive than it was. I took the blood-red wood pieces and knocked them together into the space-saving desk/shelf was meant to be. My room looks like a bad copy of a catalog photo for dorm room furniture.</p>

<p>That took more hours than I suspected and I lost the time I had scheduled for working on things, important things. Game of Thrones got in the way as well. So did a trip to Trader Joe's where I loaded up my camping bag with vegetables, bread, and trail mix. The trail mix I inhaled, pieces of chocolate and peanut butter dribbling on my bloated belly (that time of the month). It's lonely here. Do you care? Do I?</p>

<p>I'm only here now because my phone is charging. I made coffee and eggs.</p>

<p>After unloading some boxes in the closet to put books on the new shelves, I moved Paddinton's litter box into the closet. Though I moved my clothes to the far end, I am wondering if I will always smell faintly of Arm & Hammer baking soda, with clumping magic. It's not as if I could be more hideous.</p>

<p>And hideous I am, the aging monster. The worst of it is around my eyes, my father's eyes, that crumple like foil whenever I smile. They look worse than others my age. I cried a little and thought of surgeries, googled for miracle oils, Naomi Wolf's finger wagging at me the whole time. The Beauty Myth. I suppose my body is still decent, I work hard to make sure of that. The body of a gymnist, the face of Methalusah, the new mythical beast.</p>

<p>In a half hour or so, I'll bike to Joaquin Miller Park, do a little hiking, ride back. At 1pm, I have a phone call scheduled with S and J; she has news. After that, maybe I won't waste the day watching Game of Thrones - beautiful, addictive, a little stupid. One watches it for direwolves and Peter Dinklage and lusting after the savage king. </p>

<p>Started Game of Thrones last night on an HBO free trial. This was something J always wanted me to watch with him, but I refused. On what grounds? My unhappy math: fantasy fiction + multiple rape scenes. There are wolves, however, and wolf puppies: for this I am grateful.</p>

<p>At his apartment on Thursday to walk the dog. I scanned the contents of his desk, searching for an emotional trigger, something that sets off a longing or a regret. But his clutter of tools, keyboards, and a lone sock seemed nothing more than the piles of an anonymous man. The changes he makes to the apartment are telling. Last week, I walked in and he had purchased a giant, monolithic, black coffee table, very much like the coffee table I asked him to get rid of when we moved in together, except even bigger and blacker. It's an angry thing rock solid in a sunny room painted in earthy pastels. It's a message. He also keeps the bread on top of the fridge, instead of inside the fridge like I always insisted with an airtight argument that involved mold and insects.</p>

<p>This is the earliest that I have been home in a long time. Even Paddington is surprised to see me.</p>

9:51pm</p>

<p>I'm drinking cheap vodka infused with Hot Tamale candies; I've been drinking it all night. I made it for a friend for his birthday weeks ago. I can't afford wine, and it was just sitting there. I drank it almost all. I'll make him more. Drunk and high on sugar is the best high. It's seven o'clock and there's a knock at the door. I answer it in my slippers, the ones in the shape of purple foxes. The UPS man, short, thick, his khaki shorts grazing the tops of his brown knees like I don't know what. He looks guilt-stricken. I'm in my PJs, clearly inebriated. He says "i have uh a package uh you might not want it uh because it's busted a little." </p>

<p>I say to let me put my shoes on and I'll go look. On my way out, I turn to see the RAID packets in the hall. Are the ants still dead? They are. In any case, I now have pieces of a blood-red desk leaning against my wall like body parts. </p>

<p>B is something else to me now. He's a friend, I guess, but I've zippered up. Our boss took us to Atlas for a "breakfast" this morning. He talked about his "competitive" private school that groomed him for college. "Prince and the Pauper" I think, but do not say. Our boss is also from a working class family in a run-down community. She high fived me twice. She said she saw me running on Saturday, "you looked determined," she said. </p>

<p>Rich, beautiful, gay B with the happy trail to heaven. All the fucking sighs. <p>

<p>When I returned from the laundromat, there was a note from UPS apologizing for missing me. They have my desk and they are sorry. Down the hall, my neighbor, Mekonnen, was on his knees, pouring boiling water over the ant army. He is Ethipean or Eritrean; a presumption. He said that he lived here five years and that he never had a problem with ants or thieves or rapists, only loud parties held in the house next door.</p>

<p>I ran 4.76 miles. Up College Avenue, an upper class thoroughfare slathered with gourmet this and boutique that. Across Asby and back down Telegraph. I listend to the Flamin' Groovies "Slow Death" eight times. "She said go kill yourself, I said thanks a lot." </p>

Arbor Cafe, Oakland<br>
2:18pm</p>

<p>I gotta split in ten minutes, get on the BART. Krav Maga. Looks like I'm on for it twice a month. Alternating weeks I'm at GitFit with B. The rest of the time, I run.</p>

<p>It's warm, almost hot. The cafe is crowded; everyone is white. There's a Church's Chicken across the street, it's not crowded, but everyone in it is black. B says "it won't diversify itself." He meant the field of preservation, but the statement has universiality. If I wasn't a vegetarian, I'd walk into Church's Chicken right now. Is this what I should do? Find the black places and walk into them? Is that gentrifying or diversifying? Can I really not help being an asshole?</p>

<p>L's family is in town. For some reason I'm hurt she didn't invite me along to some activity. I would have invited her to something. I think she's hurt, that I hurt her.</p>

Lee's Summit, MO<br>
Afternoon</p>

<p>A storm rolls by. A terrible cliche, but true. The balcony of my parent's new apartment is painted like a gazebo: a blistering white railing and gunmetal siding. My parents are inside watching the news. "Multiple Tornados," says the weatherman's graphic that hangs as a reflection in the windows of the porch door. </p>

<p>My dad made me come inside. He said "it's headed this way." I'm in the closet again, where I was earlier with the door shut and the lights off, tearing up a little. </p>

<p>I'm on the plane. The storm passed and my flight took off as scheduled. Driving to the airport, we passed my brother's apartment building. Firetrucks, amublances, and police cars made a circle around the building like children holding hands. A crane was erected over the unit Dad said my brother lived. He said he saw smoke, I did not. </p>

<p>We kept driving. I have a flight to catch. Is my brother on fire? Should we stop? We don't. I called Mom, she didn't answer. I called my brother; also no answer. Water sprays off tires as we, a flock of SUVs and 4x4s, spew down the freeway. </p>

<p>Dad is worried, or tense, or annoyed. It's hard to tell. He complains that Mom never answers her phone, that they pay $120 a month for a phone bill for nothing. He says he'll check in with my brother's apartment building as he drives back. He can't wait for me to go and tells me to put on my backpack before we've even made a turn into the terminal parking lot.</p> 

<p>Earlier, I'm drinking with Mom in a Mexican restaurant. She says "don't let him get to you." On Friday, he called me trash, a loser. He's angry about the tattoo, about the breakup, about my 45k a year job. It gets to me. I'm thinking all weekend, maybe this why I hate myself. It's hard to tell what he's thinking, but at the same time, I always know. He's like me, holds it in until the levee breaks.</p> 

<p>There's an hour left on this flight, then we'll be in Phoenix. I've never been. I know it's just the airport, but it's the first time I'll have been to the Southwest. </p>

<p>Someone farted. It smells like an over-chlorinated swimming pool. I'm remember my Aunt's pool, and that time when her son threw all the kids in one by one. He tried to throw me in, but said I was too heavy. He made all kinds of grunting sounds like I was hurting him. The kids my age snickered. I felt I was going to sink through the concrete; so heavy and all. Even in a stranger's fart, I sniff out the roots of my resentment. </p>

<p>After the Mexican restaurant, Mom drove us to thrift stores. Intoxicated, I waded slowly through the aisles and aisles of rumpled clothes, the slightly sweet smell of old things. Stacks of teacups and piles of old toys. Self-help books with the pages torn out. In high school, I loved thrift stores, everything unique and once-belonged to the dead. I hunted for t-shirts mostly, old tourist shirts, summer camp shirts, shirts with a name not mine stitched over the heart. The more senseless it was for me to wear, the better. But we were all like that, my whole crew, weird with a purpose. </p>

<p>But now I feel out of place, like I'm not creative enough or poor enough. I look through my teenage eyes: a teal courdoury jacket, plaid pants, a t-shirt that says "i'm the hot friend." - is this the outfit I would make? I pull these things off the rack excitedly, walk around with them, feeling stranger and stranger, they hang heavy in my hands like dead things do. I put them back. My mom asks me why I don't want anything. </p>

<p>This is the first time I've been been home where I didn't see C. My mom says she's been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, and that she just put in a notice at her job. They think she can go on disability. She doesn't want to see me. I'm wondering if I should call her, reach out, let her know someone cares, for whatever it's worth. That same person farted again.</p>
